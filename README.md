# TopIcons

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phocean/TopIcons/master/screenshot.png)

An alternative to GNOME Shell's Legacy Tray, making use of the top panel.

I had a few issues with the original TopIcons extension: it froze when changing the screen geometry, like enable an external monitor. Also, I found a few forks like TopTray with some good ideas, like settings for icon size and colors. So I simply merged them all in a better extension.

## Installation

- Move the extension to <code>~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions</code>
- Reload GNOME Shell with <code>Alt+F2 r Enter</code>
- Enable the extension with *gnome-tweak-tool*

## Compatibility

GNOME Shell 3.16 and up.

## Credits

Many thanks go to Adel Gadllah for making the [original extension](http://94.247.144.115/repo/topicons/) and also to Mjnaderi for the [Toptray fork](https://github.com/mjnaderi/TopTray).

## Notes

The extension is pending review on https://extensions.gnome.org, so hopefully it will be validated so that it is easier to install soon.
