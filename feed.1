				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Context</h2>
<p>I have kept playing with Docker recently, just for fun and to learn.</p>
<p>It is very powerful, but still young. It quickly shows some limit when it comes to security or persistence. There are some workarounds, yet more or less complex, more or less hacky.</p>
<p>Indeed, I had some issues with Etherpad, which is a Nodejs application, and its integration into Docker.</p>
<p>Initially, I made something quite simple, so my Dockerfile ended like that:</p>
<pre>USER etherpad
CMD ["node","/opt/etherpad-lite/node_modules/ep_etherpad-lite/node/server.js"]</pre>
<p>Thus, I simply start the app with a low privileges user.</p>
<p>It worked, but I had two issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>Docker was not able to stop it nicely. Instead, it timed out after 10 sec and finally killed the app and the container altogether.</li>
<li>No persistence of any kind, of course.</li>
</ol>
<p>I decided to tackle these two issues to understand what was going on behind.</p>
<h2>The PID 1 issue</h2>
<p>I could not understand immediately the first issue: why was Docker unable to terminate the container properly?</p>
<p>After wandering a few hours on wrong paths (trying to get through with Nodejs nodemon or supervisor), I finally found some good articles, explaining that Docker misses an init system to catch signals, wich causes some issues with applications started with a PID = 1, which cannot be killed, or with Bash (the shell doesn&#8217;t handle transmitted signals.</p>
<p>I am not going to repeat poorly what has already been explained very well, so I encourage you to read this two excellent posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://blog.phusion.nl/2015/01/20/docker-and-the-pid-1-zombie-reaping-problem/">The PID 1 zombie reaping problem</a></li>
<li><a href="https://medium.com/@gchudnov/trapping-signals-in-docker-containers-7a57fdda7d86#.wqy8msjbk">Trapping signals in Docker containers</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You will also find a lot of bug reports in the Docker github about this issue, and a lot of hacky or overkilling solutions.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the most elegant solution among them is to use a launcher program, very simple and dedicated to catch and handle signal.</p>
<p>I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/yelp/dumb-init">Dumb-init</a>, as it is well packaged (there are plenty of options) and seems to be well maintained.</p>
<p>So, after installing Dump-init in the Dockerfile, the CMD line should now look like this:</p>
<pre>USER etherpad
CMD ["dumb-init","node","/opt/etherpad-lite/node_modules/ep_etherpad-lite/node/server.js"]</pre>
<p>And indeed, as expected, <em>docker stop</em> now works flawlessly.</p>
<h2>Volume permissions</h2>
<p>This is where I had the toughest issue, although it is supposed to be straightforward with volumes.</p>
<p>Volumes enable to share files or folders between host and containers, or between containers solely. There are plenty of possibilities, nicely illustrated on this blog:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://kvaes.wordpress.com/2016/02/11/docker-storage-patterns-for-persistence/">Docker: storage patterns for persistence</a></li>
</ul>
<p>And it works very well&#8230;. as long as you application runs as root.</p>
<p>In my case, for instance, Etherpad runs with a low privileged user, which is highly recommended. At startup, it creates a sqlite database, etherpad.db,Â  in its ./var folder.</p>
<p>Mounting a volume, of any kind, over the ./var folder, would result in a folder with root only permissions. Subsequently, of course, the launch of Etherpad from the CMD command would fail miserably.</p>
<p>Simple solutions like <em>chown</em> in the Dockerfile don&#8217;t work, because they apply <em>before</em> the mount. The <em>mount</em> occurs at runtime and works like a standard Linux <em>mount:</em> it is created by the docker daemon, with <em>root</em> permissions, over possibly existing data.</p>
<p>My solution was to completely change the way Etherpad is started. I now use an external script which is started at runtime:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, it applies the appropriate permissions to the mounted volume with <em>chown,</em></li>
<li>Then, it starts Etherpad with a low privileged user thanks to a <em>su</em> hack.</li>
</ol>
<p>So now the Dockerfile ends with:</p>
<pre>VOLUME /opt/etherpad-lite/var
ADD run-docker.sh ./bin/
CMD ["./bin/run-docker.sh"]</pre>
<p>And here is the script:</p>
<pre>#!/bin/bash

chown -R etherpad:etherpad /opt/etherpad-lite/var
su etherpad -s /bin/bash -cÂ  "dumb-init node /opt/etherpad-lite/node_modules/ep_etherpad-lite/no
de/server.js"</pre>
<p>I use a data volume for persistency, so the run command looks like this:</p>
<pre>docker run -d --name etherpad -p 80:9001 -v etherpad:/opt/etherpad-lite/var -t debian-etherpad</pre>
<p>Far from being ideal, but it works. I really hope some features are coming to bring more options in this area, especially in the Dockerfile.</p>
<h2>Some final thoughts</h2>
<p>Globally, we can still hope a lot of improvements in security, because when I look at many Dockerfiles around, I see two behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of people don&#8217;t care and everything is happily running as root, from unauthenticated third-party images or binaries&#8230;</li>
<li>Some people do care but end up with dirty hacks, because there is no other way to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is scary and so far from the Linux philosophy. Let&#8217;s wait for the enhancements to come.</p>
<p>You can find the complete <em>updated</em> Dockerfile on <a href="https://github.com/phocean/dockerfile-debian-etherpad/blob/master/Dockerfile">this github page</a>.</p>
<p>While we are on this topic, have a look to <a href="http://blog.labianchin.me/2016/02/15/docker-tips-and-tricks">this nice post with some nice tips and tricks</a> for Docker.</p>

<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/containers/dockervolumes/">volume</a> from the container <em>/root/.msf4</em> to <em>$HOME/.msf4</em>, so that you can benefit from your customized prompt, scripts and modules anytime and have persistence on them.

<li><em><a href="https://tmux.github.io/">Tmux</a></em> window manager tool, so that you can easily navigate between <em>msfconsole,</em> bash and other sessions.</li>

</ul>
<p>It is all up-to-date in <a href="https://github.com/phocean/dockerfile-debian-metasploit">its github repo</a>. I will keep adjusting it, if I feel something is missing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Managing updates and dependencies of a Metasploit installation have definitely been too much trouble and repetitive.</p>
<p>Instead of keeping reproducing boring installation steps every <em>x</em> months, I decided to build a <em>Dockerfile</em> for once.</p>
<p>I chose Debian for its good compromise between features, stability and lightness. I am aware of the Kali Dockerfile, that I could have used as a base. But:</p>
<ul>
<li>Â It is a definitely over-killing image (more than 1 GB) and, at this cost, it does not come with a fully-featured Metasploit (no database connection, for instance).</li>
<li>I like keeping minimal and controlled stuff. In other words, I like doing things on my own.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, this Debian-based Metasploit container comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>all dependencies installed,</li>
<li>automatic updates at startup,</li>
<li>a connection with the local Postgres database,</li>
<li>an improved prompt with timestamping and sessions/jobs status.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find it on <a href="https://github.com/phocean/dockerfile-debian-metasploit">my github</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any trouble or suggestion on how to improve it, please let me know. Enjoy it and go ahead if you want to fork it!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just put on my github a few dockerfiles for virtual machines that I frequently use to get some quick work done or to temporary share some data.</p>
<p>Here they are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;"><a href="https://github.com/phocean/dockerfile-debian-etherpad">Debian-based Etherpad</a></li>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;"><a href="https://github.com/phocean/dockerfile-debian-phishingfrenzy">Debian-based Phishing Frenzy</a></li>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;"><a href="https://github.com/phocean/dockerfile-debian-torbrowser">Debian-based Tor Browser</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I used to use VirtualBox guests, but maintaining them was a hassle (updates, snapshots, disk defragmation and shrinking, etc.).</p>
<p>It makes perfect sense to use Docker just for that, and on top of that it consumes much fewerÂ resources. Starting with the disk usage : all these containers along with their image stands below 1 GB!</p>
<p>The fact that I am using Btrfs as the underlying storage driver is not for nothing: compression is extremely efficient on images!</p>
<p>Note that my Dockerfiles have nothing special, you can actually find others on the Internet (and I was inspired by some).</p>
<p>There are a few differences, however:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;">I care much about security, so at least I try to make Web services not running as root, even if it is inside a container (the root user is still the same as on the host, so let&#8217;s make a compromise as unlikely as possible).</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;">I like simple things, so I tried to keep everything straightforward and simplified some stuff.</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;">I don&#8217;t like to waste disk space. So when I some Dockerfiles based on Ubuntu, Debian Wheezy, Debian Jessie, Fedora, etc., I try to unify all of them under Debian &#8220;stable&#8221; (so as of today, Jessie). Why bother with useless images? I chose a versatile and common server distribution and I am trying to stick with it.</li>
</ul>
<p>While I was playing, I had two things bothering me:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;"><a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3804">No quota support</a>: for a Samba sharing guest that I have, I would have liked to implement quotas from within the container. There is no support for that at the moment, and the global limitation by container is not nice (and once you choose a big size, you can&#8217;t go backward for existing containers&#8230;). I have a dedicated partition for Docker, so, while not perfect, it is okay for now.</li>
<li style="font-family: 'Open Sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif'; color: #444444;">The devicemapper storage driver totally sucks at this time:Â <a href="https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/3182">free space is never reclaimed after you delete images or containers</a>! So the more you use Docker, the more your partition gets full.</li>
</ul>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>Why BTRFS ?</h1>
<p>I have recently tested Btrfs as the file system for my /home partition (which was previously on ext4).</p>
<p>I have been impressedÂ by what this file system enables to do, but also came to the conclusion that it is not for me.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder, the goal of this file system is to bring to Linux a fully featured file system similar to zfs. Some of these featuresÂ promise a lot of awesomeness: snapshots, native RAID, automatic defragmentation and repairs, etc.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool to have such a file system for your data? Among them, snapshotting really is a killer feature. See it as a global git for all your data. You can trackÂ any file history, make a diff comparison on them and revert back to a chosen version, anytime and on-line.</p>
<p>Btrfs has been under development for a while and it is still undergoing. However, the first stable version has finally been released last year.</p>
<p>ManyÂ people warnÂ that it is not production ready yet. It seems obvious for critical production systems, under heavy load or using the most advanced features (e.g. RAID). But what about a simple /home, mainly using snapshots (which have been aroundÂ for a while)?</p>
<p>You will see that there are still some issues with virtualization.</p>
<p><strong><em>Disclaimer 1: this is in no way a review or a benchmark of Btrfs. Consider it simply as some feedback for my specific use case.</em></strong></p>
<h1>Getting ready</h1>
<p>This chapter is a summary of procedures found in various resources, along with my feedback.</p>
<p><em><strong>Disclaimer 2: First of all, make several backup of your entire /home. And make sure that it is operational and complete. Anyway, beware that thereÂ is obviously some inherent risk for your data in manipulating your home partition. So, do not come back to insult me if you lose any data.</strong></em></p>
<p>First,Â note that there is a conversion utility <em>btrfs-convert</em>, to convert an existing ext4 partition to btrfs. While this sounds cool, it did not work well with my partition, leading to many corrupted inodes.</p>
<p>So my advice is to just make a good backup of your home:</p>
<pre>% rsync -av /home /your/backup/</pre>
<p>Then, log out and format the partition as root:</p>
<pre>#Â mount | grep home
/dev/mapper/system-home on /home type ext4 (rw,noatime,data=ordered)
# umount /home
# mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/system-home</pre>
<p>Change the file system and its options in /etc/fstab. For example:</p>
<pre>/dev/system/home Â  Â  /home Â  Â  ext4 Â  Â  defaults,noatime Â  Â  1 1</pre>
<p>should become (also note the change on the last digit):</p>
<pre>/dev/system/home Â  /home Â  Â btrfs Â defaults,noatime,ssd,space_cache,compress=lzoÂ  Â  1 0</pre>
<p>Re-mount /home and you are done!</p>
<h1>Snapper</h1>
<p>The main purpose for me to test Btrfs was the snapshot feature, in the hope to keep a version history of each file and avoid accidental deletions and changes.</p>
<p>Of course, one could use the Btrfs commands and implement snapshots manually. But why reinventing the wheel?</p>
<p>The guys behind <a href="http://snapper.io/">snapper</a>Â  already made a service especially for that. It is basically a wrapper over Btrfs that will make automatic snapshots in the background, based on your frequency settings, and ease their handling.</p>
<p>Once installed, it can be enabled with the following command:</p>
<pre># snapper -c home create-config /home</pre>
<p>It has the effect of creating a configuration file, where you can adjust the number of snapshots you want to keep per day, week, month, etc. Of course, don&#8217;t keep too much data as it will waste free space, especially if you happen to move large amounts of data. Hourly and daily snapshots are OK, as they would be cleaned up quickly. But monthly or yearly snapshots wouldÂ consume a lot of space and would be pretty useless for a /home.</p>
<p>Here is what I used, without consuming much more than 10 GB:</p>
<pre># subvolume to snapshot
SUBVOLUME="/home"

# filesystem type
FSTYPE="btrfs"

# users and groups allowed to work with config
ALLOW_USERS=""
ALLOW_GROUPS="

# sync users and groups from ALLOW_USERS and ALLOW_GROUPS to .snapshots
# directory
SYNC_ACL="no"

# start comparing pre- and post-snapshot in background after creating
# post-snapshot
BACKGROUND_COMPARISON="yes"

# run daily number cleanup
NUMBER_CLEANUP="yes"

# limit for number cleanup
NUMBER_MIN_AGE="1800"
NUMBER_LIMIT="10"
NUMBER_LIMIT_IMPORTANT="5"

# create hourly snapshots
TIMELINE_CREATE="yes"

# cleanup hourly snapshots after some time
TIMELINE_CLEANUP="yes"

# limits for timeline cleanup
TIMELINE_MIN_AGE="1800"
<strong>TIMELINE_LIMIT_HOURLY="10"</strong>
<strong>TIMELINE_LIMIT_DAILY="7"</strong>
<strong>TIMELINE_LIMIT_WEEKLY="2"</strong>
TIMELINE_LIMIT_MONTHLY="0"
TIMELINE_LIMIT_YEARLY="0"

# cleanup empty pre-post-pairs
EMPTY_PRE_POST_CLEANUP="yes"

# limits for empty pre-post-pair cleanup
EMPTY_PRE_POST_MIN_AGE="1800"</pre>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s play a little. In the following sequence, we create a file containing &#8220;Hello World!&#8221;, we then create a manual snapshot, change the file and display the differences:</p>
<pre># vim test.txt
# snapper -c home create --description "before test"
# vim test.txt
# sudo snapper -c home list
Type   | # | Pre # | Date                     | User | Cleanup  | Description  | Userdata

<p>Neat, isn&#8217;t it? Now, what if we decide to restore the file to this snapshot:</p>
<pre>snapper -c home undochange 1..0 /home/phocean/test.txt</pre>
<p>That&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>Note that all these operations can be done against the entire partition (no argument needed), a folder or a file.</p>
<h1>Pros</h1>
<p>Regarding regular files, I had no issue at all. After a week of intensive use, I already the occasion to enjoy the benefits of having snapshots and being able to restore a file.</p>
<p>On the performance side, even though I haven&#8217;t done any benchmark, it is a least as fast as ext4. It is said that under some conditions, compression can be a big read rate boost.</p>
<p>On the compression side, on my partition of 400 GB, it allowed me to reclaim around 20 GB of space. Of course, the gainÂ you can expect is totally related to the sorts of files you have (you won&#8217;t gain much on files that are already compressed or encrypted).</p>
<h1>Cons</h1>
<p>As warned on the official wiki itself,Â you should not use Btrfs as-isÂ with database or virtualization solutions.</p>
<p>Dixit the official wiki:</p>
<blockquote><p>Files with a lot of random writes can become heavily fragmented (10000+ extents) causing trashing on HDDs and excessive multi-second spikes of CPU load on systems with an SSD or large amount a RAM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, I quickly experienced some issues with Virtualbox. Under heavy I/O operations, and having several machines running at a time, I had the guest file systems corrupted more than once. And so badlyÂ that the guest machineÂ was unrecoverable (even withÂ snapshots). Sometimes I got plenty of ext4 errors, or sometimes it just froze, while copying a bunch of file or doing an <em>apt-get upgrade.</em>..</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Btrfs#Copy-On-Write_.28CoW.29">workarounds</a> did not make it for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>I even did not test disabling CoW for the whole partition. It kills one of the main advantages of using Btrfs.</li>
<li>I tried disabling CoW for all the VM folder. While the corruption frequency decreased, it still occurred after a while.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I would simply adivse of not putting any virtual machine on the Btrfs partitions, until this thing definitely get sorted. I use virtual machines intensively at work and need them to be reliable.</p>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>Btrfs is awesome and pretty stable at this time, unless you need to host virtual machines.Â You couldÂ still have a dedicate ext4 partition for you VMs, and enjoy Btrfs for the rest of your home.</p>
<p>To be honest, I did not bother (not wanting to manage several partitions), and switched back to ext4 for all, in the expectation of better days.Â I am not sure if this should be addressed on the Btrfs, or the Virtualbox side (or both).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ARP spoofing is a good old attack on LAN and still a devastating one, leading to trafic interception (MiTM). You may want to make sure that nobody is tricking on you at office, at a security conference, at you local coffee shop, etc.</p>
<p>Yet, most networks do not have port security and ARP inspect on their switches to mitigate such attacks. So you have to count on yourself.</p>
<p>Most people know how to protect a client , e.g. by maintaining a static mapping of MAC / IP addresses on the operating systems. But almost no one does it, because it would be a pain to manage&#8230;</p>
<p>But, really ? No, here is what I do to get a reasonable protection.</p>
<p>I do a few compromises at first:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I am not looking to protect ALL my traffic</span> towardÂ  other peers on the LAN, but at least outbound communications with the gateway and, optionally, with a few critical servers.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">An attacker may still poison the gateway</span> and eavesdrop on responses directed to my machine, and get some interesting stuff anyway.</li>
<li>So, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">this is not a protection on its own</span>. You have to think defense-in-depth : encryption on all your services (TLS), VPN, etc. Especially, depending on where you are, do not rely on the DNS / DHCP servers.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that said, what follows is a hardening move that you can do on most of Linux distributions, with little pain.</p>
<p>Get the MAC address of the gateway, either by finding it out physically (tag) or by checking it at a safe moment (when ARP spoofing is supposedly not happening).</p>
<p>Fill in a flat file, like /etc/ethers, with mappings like :</p>
<pre>Â 00:11:22:33:44:55Â  1.2.3.4</pre>
<p>Now, NetworkManager will do all the magic.</p>
<p>Create a script like :</p>
<pre>Â % cat /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/40-arp 
Â #!/bin/bash
Â arp -f /etc/ethers
</pre>
<p>All scripts in the above folder will be executed every time an interface gets up, as long as you give it executable rights :</p>
<pre>% chmod +x /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/40-arp</pre>
<p>Now, either execute it directly or unplug / plug back in your interface. You should have a permanent static MAC address now, effectively bypassing the ARP protocol and its weaknesses :</p>
<pre>% arp -a -n
? (172.16.100.254) at 00:15:17:9d:d6:d1 [ether] PERM on eth0</pre>
<p>VoilÃ ! Should you not use NetworkManager for some reason, you can do something equivalent with <em>ifup</em> scripts in respect with the syntax of you current Linux distribution.</p>
<p>But, let me stress it out once more, to be sure you don&#8217;t get me wrong :</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Despite an enhancement, this is no a sufficient protection and you may still get pwned ! Authentication and encryption MUST also come into the play, so use only TLS enabled services, HTTPS sites and, ideally, a good IPSEC / SSH / TLS tunnel to carry ALL of your traffic !</span></strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update 2015/08/04</span>: Works on Fedora 22 too. I recently applied the exact same procedure with success.</span></em></p>
<p>A quick update from aÂ previous <a href="https://phocean.net/2014/02/23/metasploit-on-fedora-20.html">post</a>Â for setting Metasploit on Fedora 21, the latest version.</p>
<p>It is mainly a copy and paste, except for a few typo fixes and some changes on the Ruby part. The good news is that Metasploit was recently ported to Ruby 2.x, so we don&#8217;t need anymore the <em>rvm</em> stuff anymore, which makes the process much simpler.</p>
<h1>Preparing Postgresql</h1>
<p>Install:</p>
<pre> yum -y install postgresql-server postgresql-devel</pre>
<p>Initiate a new &#8220;cluster&#8221; and connect to the sql client through the <code>postgres</code> user:</p>
<pre># as root:
postgresql-setup initdb
systemctl start postgresql.service
su postgres
psql</pre>
<p>Inside the psql console, create the new Metasploit user and its database:</p>
<pre>create user msf;
alter user msf with encrypted password 'super password';
create database msfdb;
grant all privileges on database msfdb to msf;
\q</pre>
<p>Then, we will tell to Postgres how to accept local connections. ident necessitates an system account, trust means no password for any local account and md5 stands for a classic password authentication, which we will prefer.<br />
Back to a root terminal, add this line insideÂ <code>/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf</code> and beware that the order is important:</p>
<pre># IPv4 local connections:
<span style="color: #ff0000;">host msfdb msf 127.0.0.1/32 md5</span>
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 ident</pre>
<p>Then we can restart the service and check with psql that the credentials are working:</p>
<pre>systemctl restart postgresql.service
psql -U msf msfdb -h localhost
\q</pre>
<h1>Setting Ruby</h1>
<p>Metasploit runs well with Ruby 1.9.3, so we will install this version and switch to it using <code>rbenv</code>.<br />
<code>rbenv</code> does a nice job at managing several version of ruby next to each other, installing dependancies (as OpenSSL) and setting <code>PATH</code>:</p>
<pre># as root:
yum install ruby rubygems ruby-devel rubygem-bundler</pre>
<h1>Getting and running Metasploit</h1>
<p>Install:</p>
<pre># as root in e.g. /opt
git clone https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework.git msf
cd msf
yum -y install libpcap-devel sqlite-devel
./msfupdate</pre>
<p>The installation of ruby modules will take a while. Then, configure the database by creating <code>config/database.yml</code>:</p>
<pre>production:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: msfdb
    username: msf
    password: 
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    pool: 75
    timeout: 5</pre>
<p>Launch it and have fun :</p>
<pre># as root
./msfconsole
# check connection to the database
db_status</pre>
<p>You may want toÂ add a <code>cron</code> entry in <code>/etc/crontab</code>Â to get regular updates (though it may break from time to time due to broken dependencies, so you are advised to check it sometimes):</p>
<pre># msfupdate every 2 hours
0 */2 * * * root /opt/msf/msfupdate 2&gt;&amp;1</pre>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>No fresh news, but I had been wanting to test the Heartbleed vulnerability for a while and just missed time.</p>
<p>I used the following quick setup:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Debian 7.0</strong>Â virtual machine as a vulnerable host</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/heartleech">Heartleech</a> tool. There are many other tools around, but this one was suggested to me by a coworker,Â whoÂ used it successfully during a pentest.</li>
</ol>
<p>Getting a vulnerable host in your own environment is not that trivial, as most OS have now been patched (including the installation ISO of supported versions).</p>
<p>In my quest, I ended up with Debian 7.0 (Debian 6.x are too old and actually do not suffer from the vulnerability).</p>
<p>To download an old and unpatched installation image of Debian,Â you need to use <em><strong>Jigdo</strong></em>. This tool will download all packages from the archive site of Debian and rebuild the ISO:</p>
<pre>jigdo-lite ftp://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/7.0.0/i386/jigdo-dvd/debian-7.0.0-i386-DVD-1.jigdo</pre>
<p>Then, create a virtual machine with no network card, to make sure that the installation process does not retrieve any patch.</p>
<p>Once the Debian virtual machine is set and running:</p>
<ol>
<li>Edit &lt;code&gt;/etc/apt/source.list&lt;/code&gt; to comment out lines concerning security updates (keep only the DVD enabled)</li>
<li>Add and configure a network card (&lt;code&gt;eth0&lt;/code&gt;)</li>
<li>Install <em><strong>Apache2</strong></em></li>
<li>Enable SSL: <code>a2enmod ssl</code></li>
<li>Enable the default SSL web pages: &lt;code&gt;e2ensite default-ssl&lt;/code&gt;</li>
<li>Open a browser to check that it all works at &lt;code&gt;https://hostname&lt;/code&gt;</li>
</ol>
<p>Using heartleech is incredibly fast and straightforward:</p>
